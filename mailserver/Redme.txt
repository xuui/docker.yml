Start the Compose project
To start your compose project, simply run the Docker Compose up command using -p mailu flag for project name.

cd /mailu
docker-compose -p mailu up -d

Before you can use Mailu, you must create the primary administrator user account. This should be admin@ma.xuui.net. Use the following command, changing PASSWORD to your liking:

docker-compose -p mailu exec admin flask mailu admin admin ma.xuui.net PASSWORD

Login to the admin interface to change the password for a safe one, at one of the hostnames ma.xuui.net. Also, choose the "Update password" option in the left menu.
